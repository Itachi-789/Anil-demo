    <p>
        The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. This is because of the Earth's rotation on its axis, which causes the sun to appear to move across the sky. The Earth rotates in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from the North Pole, and it takes 24 hours to complete one rotation. This gives us the cycle of day and night and helps to regulate the rhythm of life on our planet. As the sun moves across the sky, its position changes, and the length of daylight and nighttime changes throughout the year, giving us the changing seasons.
